## af cli login issues {#af-cli-login}

If you can log into the web console, but you're running into issues with the `af login` command, try this: 

    $ rm ~/.af_token
    $ af login

## Error (JSON 502) 

The most common reason for this is your app running out of available RAM. When that happens, AppFog kills the app and attempts to re-spawn it. While it's down, you see 404. To fix this, simply add more RAM to your app: 

    $ af mem <appname> <memory>
