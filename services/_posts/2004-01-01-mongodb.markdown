AppFog provides a MongoDB service that's accessible to apps that are running on any of the supported runtimes and frameworks. 

# Ruby on Rails

Gemfile
$ gem install "mongo\_mapper"
$ gem install "bson\_ext"
Add BSON for serialization of JSON-like documents; it is needed to interface with the MongoDB Ruby driver.

Rails
If your application is a Rails app, modify the production section of config/mongo.yml to set credentials, host, and port for Cloud Foundry by parsing the JSON-formatted VCAP\_SERVICES environment variable.

production:
host: <%= JSON.parse(ENV['VCAP_SERVICES'])['mongodb-1.8'].first['credentials']['hostname'] rescue 'localhost' %>
port: <%= JSON.parse( ENV['VCAP_SERVICES'] )['mongodb-1.8'].first['credentials']['port'] rescue 27017 %>
database:  <%= JSON.parse( ENV['VCAP_SERVICES'] )['mongodb-1.8'].first['credentials']['db'] rescue 'tutorial_db' %>
username: <%= JSON.parse( ENV['VCAP_SERVICES'] )['mongodb-1.8'].first['credentials']['username'] rescue '' %>
password: <%= JSON.parse( ENV['VCAP_SERVICES'] )['mongodb-1.8'].first['credentials']['password'] rescue '' %>
If your application is not a Rails app, the JSON.parse() code in the previous step demonstrates how to extract from VCAP\_SERVICES the information you need to construct a MongoDB connection string to access the Cloud Foundry MongoDB service.

Bundle
$ bundle package
$ bundle install

# Node.js

Before you begin, review these prerequisites:

Cloud Foundry account and vmc

Node.js installed on your development machine

MongoDB, the open source NoSQL database, installed on your development computer

See Node.js Application Development with Cloud Foundry for a first tutorial on deploying Node.js applications.

Using the Cloud Foundry MongoDB Service

MongoDB is a scalable, open source, document-oriented database provided as a service at Cloud Foundry. This section describes how you can create Node.js applications that use this service. The examples are coded so that you can run and test them locally as well as on Cloud Foundry. Code for these examples can be found at GitHub.

Setup
Start mongod in your local environment with the following command:

$ mongod
Confirm that Node.js is correctly installed:

Run node to start the interactive javascript console:
$ node
Press Control-C to exit.

Check that Node Package Manager (NPM) is installed:
$ npm -v
1.0.6
Target Cloud Foundry and log in with your Cloud Foundry credentials:

$ vmc target api.cloudfoundry.com
$ vmc login
Create a Working Node.js Application for Cloud Foundry
In this step, you create a basic application and make sure that it works locally and on Cloud Foundry.

Note
Throughout this tutorial, we use the name “mongo-node” for the application. When you deploy to Cloud Foundry you must choose a different, unique name.
Create an application directory and change into it:

$ mkdir mongo-node
$ cd mongo-node
Create a file app.js containing the following code:

var port = (process.env.VMC_APP_PORT || 3000);
var host = (process.env.VCAP_APP_HOST || 'localhost');
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(port, host);
This creates a Node.js web server using port 3000 on localhost that responds to any HTTP request with the string “Hello World.”

Start the Node.js web server locally:

$ node app.js
In another terminal window send a request:

$ curl localhost:3000
Hello World
Alternatively, browse to http://localhost:3000 to see the response from the web server.

Press Control-C in the first terminal window to stop the web server.

Push the application to Cloud Foundry. Press Enter to accept the defaults, except enter a unique name for the application, and set up a mongodb service, as shown in the following vmc transcript:

$ vmc push
Would you like to deploy from the current directory? [Yn]:

1: mongodb
2: mysql

Cloud Foundry stages and starts your application.

Test the application.

$ curl mongo-node.cloudfoundry.com
Hello World
Add MongoDB Configuration
In the previous step, you deployed the application and bound it to a Cloud Foundry mongodb service, although the application does not yet use the service.

In this step, you update the application to set up MongoDB connection information and credentials, whether the application is running locally or on the cloud.

Add the following code to the beginning of app.js:
if(process.env.VCAP_SERVICES){
var env = JSON.parse(process.env.VCAP_SERVICES);
var mongo = env['mongodb-1.8'][0]['credentials'];
}
else{
var mongo = {
"hostname":"localhost",
"port":27017,
"username":"",
"password":"",
"name":"",
"db":"db"
}
}

var generate_mongo_url = function(obj){
obj.hostname = (obj.hostname || 'localhost');
obj.port = (obj.port || 27017);
obj.db = (obj.db || 'test');

if(obj.username && obj.password){
return "mongodb://" + obj.username + ":" + obj.password + "@" + obj.hostname + ":" + obj.port + "/" + obj.db;
}
else{
return "mongodb://" + obj.hostname + ":" + obj.port + "/" + obj.db;
}
}

var mongourl = generate_mongo_url(mongo);
The if provides two different sets of information, depending on whether the application is running on the cloud or locally. generate_mongo_url creates appropriate connection information for MongoDB, which is then assigned to mongourl.

Test the application locally:
$ node app.js
In another terminal:
$ curl localhost:3000
The application returns the string “Hello World”.

Update the deployed cloud application:
$ vmc update mongo-node
Uploading Application:
Checking for available resources: OK
Packing application: OK
Uploading (1K): OK

Stopping Application: OK
Staging Application: OK
Starting Application: OK
Test the deployed application:
$ curl mongo-node.cloudfoundry.com
Hello World
Add MongoDB Functionality
Next, install the MongoDB native drivers locally and update the application to use MongoDB.

Install MongoDB native drivers locally:
$ npm install mongodb
This creates a new local directory, node_modules, in the application root.

In app.js, create a new function, record_visit, that stores the server request to MongoDB:
var record_visit = function(req, res){
/* Connect to the DB and auth */
require('mongodb').connect(mongourl, function(err, conn){
conn.collection('ips', function(err, coll){
/* Simple object to insert: ip address and date */
object_to_insert = { 'ip': req.connection.remoteAddress, 'ts': new Date() };

/* Insert the object then print in response */
/* Note the _id has been created */
coll.insert( object_to_insert, {safe:true}, function(err){
res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
res.write(JSON.stringify(object_to_insert));
res.end('\n');
});
});
});
}
The .connect method connects to MongoDB using either the local or Cloud Foundry mongourl. Then the .collection('ips', ...) method adds the request information to the data that will be committed.

Update the http.createServer method so that it calls the record_visit function when the server request is made:
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
record_visit(req, res);
}).listen(port, host);
Test the application locally:
$ node app.js
and from another terminal:

$ curl localhost:3000
{"ip":"127.0.0.1","ts":"2011-12-29T23:22:38.192Z","_id":"4efcf63ecab9a5b41e000001"}
Press Control-C in the first terminal to stop the web server.

Test the application on Cloud Foundry:
$ vmc update mongo-node
$ curl appname.cloudfoundry.com
{"ip":"127.0.0.1","ts":"2011-12-29T23:24:25.199Z","_id":"4efcf6a927996b5f79000001"}
Create a function print_visits that prints the last ten visits/requests:
var print_visits = function(req, res){
/* Connect to the DB and auth */
require('mongodb').connect(mongourl, function(err, conn){
conn.collection('ips', function(err, coll){
coll.find({}, {limit:10, sort:[['_id','desc']]}, function(err, cursor){
cursor.toArray(function(err, items){
res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
for(i=0; i<items.length;i++){
res.write(JSON.stringify(items[i]) + "\n");
}
res.end();
});
});
});
});
}
Update the createServer method to call the new print_visits function:
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
params = require('url').parse(req.url);
if(params.pathname === '/history') {
print_visits(req, res);
}
else{
record_visit(req, res);
}
}).listen(port, host);
Web server requests will either add the current visit to MongoDB (the default) or, if url includes “/history”, output the last ten visits.

Test the application locally:
$ curl localhost:3000
{"ip":"127.0.0.1","ts":"2011-12-29T23:44:30.254Z","_id":"4efcfb5e2f9d30481f000003"}
$ curl localhost:3000/history
{"ip":"127.0.0.1","ts":"2011-12-29T23:44:30.254Z","_id":"4efcfb5e2f9d30481f000003"}
{"ip":"127.0.0.1","ts":"2011-12-29T23:31:39.339Z","_id":"4efcf85b2f9d30481f000002"}
{"ip":"127.0.0.1","ts":"2011-12-29T23:31:26.678Z","_id":"4efcf84e2f9d30481f000001"}
{"ip":"127.0.0.1","ts":"2011-12-29T23:22:38.192Z","_id":"4efcf63ecab9a5b41e000001"}
