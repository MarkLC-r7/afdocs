#### How reliable is AppFog? {#reliable}


#### What type of SLA does AppFog offer? {#sla}


#### Is my app still running when AppFog is under maintenance? {#maintenance}

Yes. While the PHP Fog website and your app console will be inaccessible during maintenance, your app will continue to run. You'll also continue to have access to your source code. 

#### How secure is AppFog? {#secure}

We take security very seriously. For a full walkthrough of our security precautions, check out [this page](/security).

#### Does AppFog support SSL? {#ssl}

We provide SSL for all *.phpfogapp.com subdomains and support SSL on custom subdomains, including www. Check out [this guide](/customize/ssl) for additional details.

#### Is AppFog PCI compliant? {#pci}

We're not PCI compliant as a service or as a host yet. We are in the process of getting PCI compliance certification for our service. We have no current plans for offering PCI compliance on our hosting, but if you'd like to see it, let us know by contacting [support@appfog.com](mailto:support@appfog.com).

#### Do I have to modify my app to run on AppFog? {#modify}

Nope. We've set everything up to run without any changes.

#### Can I get SSH access? {#ssh}

To maintain security across our service, we don't offer SSH access. 

#### Can I get FTP access? {#ftp}

We have an SFTP feature on our roadmap, but no ETA. Meanwhile, you can access your source code using our [PF Command Line Tool](/getting-started/pf-command-line-tool) or [Git](/getting-started/git).

#### What versions of stuff? {#version}
