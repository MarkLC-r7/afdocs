When you run the `af update` command on a Django app, AppFog automatically runs the `syncdb` command against the bound database for you as part of the staging process.

More coming soon. Meanwhile, check out [the GitHub repo for our Python Django Jumpstart](https://github.com/appfog/af-python-django).
