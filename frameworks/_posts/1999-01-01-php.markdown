### Supported Versions

For the most reliable experience, make sure you have the same version of PHP installed on your local development environment as the target AppFog instance. You can check the available runtimes by running: 

{: .prettyprint }
    $ af runtimes
    
    +--------------+-----------------+-----------+
    | Name         | Description     | Version   |
    +--------------+-----------------+-----------+
    | java         | Java 7          | 1.7.0     |
    | php          | PHP 5           | 5.3       |
    | ruby18       | Ruby 1.8.7      | 1.8.7     |

    +--------------+-----------------+-----------+

AppFog supports PHP with `Apache 2.2.22` and `mod_php`. You can take a closer look at the PHP and Apache configurations [here](http://phpinfo.aws.af.cm/info.php).

### Persistent Data Storage

AppFog does not yet have a persistent data storage system, though we're working on it. This means that the file system is volatile and any data that needs to be persistent should be included in the code base (by making all changes in a local development environment) or offloaded to a database or an external storage system like Amazon's S3.  

### Services

You can connect your PHP app to AppFog services by using the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable, which becomes available to your app when you bind a service to it. You can access the variable in PHP like this: 

{: .prettyprint}
    getenv('VCAP_SERVICES')

For more information on this, check out our [Services Overview](/services/overview) page.

# Custom PHP App {#custom}

### Create the App

Create a directory for the app and change into it:

{: .prettyprint }
    $ mkdir php-example
    $ cd php-example

Create an `index.php` file with the following:

{: .prettyprint .linenums}
    <?php echo "Hello world!"; ?>

### Deploy to AppFog

{: .prettyprint }
    $ af push php-example
    Would you like to deploy from the current directory? [Yn]:
    Detected a PHP Application, is this correct? [Yn]:
    Application Deployed URL [php-example.aws.af.cm]:

# Drupal {#drupal}

The following is a step-by-step guide to deploying a Drupal app to AppFog.

### Download Drupal

[Download Drupal](http://drupal.org/project/download/), unzip it to a new directory, and change into that directory.

Then create your `settings.php` file:

{: .prettyprint}
    $ cp ./sites/default/default.settings.php > settings.php

### Services

In `settings.php`, replace `database();` with:

{: .prettyprint .linenums}
    $services = getenv('VCAP_SERVICES'); 
    $services_json = json_decode($services,true); 
    $mysql_config = $services_json["mysql-5.1"][0]["credentials"]; 
    $databases['default']['default'] = array( 
        'driver' => 'mysql',
        'database' => $mysql_config["name"],
        'username' => $mysql_config["user"],
        'password' => $mysql_config["password"],
        'host' => $mysql_config["hostname"],
        'port' => $mysql_config["port"],
    );

### Deploy to AppFog

Push your code, making sure to create and bind a new MySQL service to the app:

    $ af push

### Finish the Drupal Install

Point your browser to your app's install script, in this case drupal-example.aws.af.cm/install.php.
